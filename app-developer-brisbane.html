        <h2>A local Brisbane app developer creating world-class apps</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve worked with clients from around the world to create apps for all
          kinds of industries and purposes.  From AirBnB clones to market management
          and mapping applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you’re part of an existing business, an entrepreneur or you’re
          just looking to make your mark on the world, I can help you do it.

        <h2>You want a great app at a price that makes sense</h2>
        <p>
          Can you afford $60,000 to $80,000 for an app? Probably not!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re not as big as Telstra and don’t have the budget of Commbank, you’re in luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can create your app for a fraction of that price without a sacrifice in quality or polish.

        <h2>No matter what people say, design matters!</h2>
        <p>
          We’re all spoilt by being constantly exposed to incredibly well designed webpages and apps every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be competitive, your app has to be even better than what people are used to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many Brisbane App Developers couldn’t design themselves out of a wet paper bag, but I’ve got you covered.
