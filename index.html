            Understanding the problem being solved is the crucial first step. We’ll work with you and your existing customers (if required)
            to ensure that the software project will not only meet your business goals, but will also do so within your timeframe and budget,
            with no surprises.

            Once the project scope is understood, the project can be planned with clear milestones determined. Your business will have
            clear guidelines on when you can expect deliverables.

            Wireframes and mockups are created before we move into a detailed design phase where your product will be designed with your

            <h3>Project outcomes <span class='italics'>do not align</span> with business goals</h3>
            <p>
              Standard application development by freelancers or less experienced companies involves working loosely off a vague set of specifications set soleley from the client.  This leads to a lack of understanding between the product team and the client, which can lead to an unsatisfactory end product.

            <h3>Business goals are the <b>core driver</b> of the project</h3>
            <p>
              Business goals, ideal outcomes and risks are defined at the very beginning of each project in order to define the requirements of the product.  This creates the foundation of everything moving forward, including prototyping, design and development.

            <h3>Tech talk and <span class='italics'>developer hibernation</span></h3>
            <p>
              Developers are notorious for 'going dark' for large periods of time, where they could be building exactly what your business does <span class='italics'>not want</span>.  Developers can also be difficult to talk to, often going too deep into the technology without understanding the business needs.

            <p>
              While we love technology, we understand that not everyone cares about the nitty gritty and that’s why we tailor the depth of the 'tech talk' to the client. You’ll also receive weekly updates and testable iterations of your final product from the project manager.

              Freelancers and less experiences developers tend to win a client and start building as soon as possible from loosely defined specifications, in order to finish as quickly as possible and get another client. This can lead to poorly thought out software products and poor results for your business and customers.

            <h3>A tested <b>system</b></h3>
            <p>
              Every devwalks client works through our tested software development project system where business goals, unique opportunities and risks are defined before we start prototyping.  After prototyping and design, we ensure we have client sign-off prior to touching any code in order to de-risk the costs associated with feature or design changes.  During each of these phases, you’ll receive weekly deliverables for complete transparency.
