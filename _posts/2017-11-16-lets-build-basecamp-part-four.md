### Introduction

We've setup the foundation of our project management application and now it's time to implement a piece of functionality that will make it actually useful.

Live chat!

In Basecamp, this feature is known as Campfire and is used for casual communication within the team.

Let's build it now.

### Creating the Chat Room

Before we get too excited creating our Action Cable functionality, let's first create the bones of how our chat room will look.

Here's what you should do first:

- Create a new chat controller method, route and view.
- Put some dummy text on the view (don't worry about functionality or styling yet, we'll attack that in a moment).
- Link the "Campfire" button / card on the project home page to your new route.

If you've made it this far in the tutorial then you have the skills to to all of the above.  Make it happen!

![Your Turn!](/content/images/2015/06/YourTurn-1.png)

------

If the above is beyond you, fear not! Here's what to doâ€¦

First, add your new controller method to your Projects Controller at `app/controllers/project_controller.rb`:

```ruby
def chat
  @project = Project.find(params[:id])
end
```

Pop that action right below your existing "show" method or anywhere that makes sense for you (expect underneath the `private` section!).

Now your chat method is going to look for a view to render that is also called chat. Create that file at `app/views/project/chat.html.erb` and add some compelling dummy text:

```erb
<h1>Hello Chat!</h1>
```

Now all that's left to do is to let our router know what we want.  In your router file (`config/routes.rb`) add the details for your new chat method and route. The whole `routes.rb` file should now look like:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'projects', to: 'project#index'
  get 'projects/:id', to: 'project#show', as: 'project'
  get 'projects/:id/chat', to: 'project#chat', as: 'project_chat' # OUR NEW ROUTE!
  post 'projects', to: 'project#create'
end
```

Now if you were to navigate to `localhost:3000/projects/{{ an id of a project you have}}/chat`, you'll see our compelling new chat page!

Let's link it up to our Campfire button from our project page by adding the correct link at `app/views/project/show.html.erb`:

```erb
<main class="container home">
  <h1 class="project-title text-center">
    <%= @project.name %>
  </h1>
  <div class="row">
    <%= render "feature_card", feature_link: project_chat_path(@project.id), title: "Campfire", img_src: "campfire", img_alt: "", description: "Chat with the group, ask questions and share stuff." %>

    # Lots of extra bits below this removed for the sake of clarity

```

As you can see above, we can simply add our link as an argument when we render our "feature_card" for our Campfire functionality!

Jump into your browser again and make sure that your link is working as it should before we make our chat room look like a chat room.

### Let's make it look like a chat room

Now that everything is linked up, let's make our chat room look like a chat room.

A nice little UX feature that Basecamp has is an easy way to link back to the root project page from each individual feature which appears as a centered link at the top of each page.  We'll be using this little navigation helper for each feature (chat, to-do lists etc), so let's create a partial view that we can re-use.

Create a new partial view called `app/views/project/_project_nav.html.erb` with the following markup:

```erb
<div class="project-nav">
  <p>
    <%= link_to @project.name, project_path(@project.id) %>
    <span>
      > <%= feature_name %>
    </span>
  </p>
</div>
```

This very simple view will display a link back to the root of our project and also display the name of the current page we're on to help our users understand their location.

Render this view from our `chat.html.erb` view like so:

```erb
<main class="container home">
  <%= render "project_nav.html", feature_name: "Campfire" %>
</main>
```

And to make it look as it should, add this css to your `app/assets/img/stylesheets/project.scss` file:

```scss
.project-nav {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 1.6rem;

  a {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

![Project nav](/assets/img/posts/basecamp-4/project-nav.png)

Now let's create the wrapper that will contain our sent messages as well as the form that we'll be using to send the messages to our teammates.

Back in your `chat.html.erb` template, update it so that it mirrors the following code:

```erb
<main class="container home">
  <%= render "project_nav.html", feature_name: "Campfire" %>
  <div class="chat-wrapper feature-card">
    <div id="chat-contents" class="chat-contents">
    </div>
    <%= form_for @message, remote: true, url: "/messages", html: {id: "new-message-form", class: "chat-form"} do |f| %>
      <div class="form-group">
        <%= f.text_field :content, class: "form-control", id: "message-input", placeholder: "Say something riveting!", autoFocus: true %>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>
</main>
```

We've added a `chat-wrapper` div that also borrows some styling from our `feature-card` class as well.

Below that we have an empty (for the moment) `#chat-contents` div where our messages will end up.

Below that, we have our new form that will create a message for us once we implement that functionality.

Before we move on, open up your `app/assets/img/stylesheets/project.scss` file once again and add the below to the bottom of that file:

```scss
.chat-wrapper {
  min-height: 80vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  .chat-form {
    margin-top: auto;
  }
}
```

Refresh your chat page to see our nice white chat wrapper!

### Dummy functionality

Before we implement our Action Cable functionality, let's just implement functionality where we can save messages from our new chat form and then display upon creation. We'll do this using the old-fashioned controller way.

Once we've implemented that, our Action Cable tie in will be incredibly easy!

I want you to take a moment and think about what's required at this point. The functionality that we're creating here is *incredibly* similar to what we implemented when we want to create a new project.

- There's a form that we can submit (that contains our chat input).
- On submission we create a new `Message` (yet to be implemented) record in a controller method .
- Once the record is created, the controller return some JavaScript that is run on the client side.

And that's it!

With that in mind, do your very best to create this functionality, leaning on the code you wrote earlier in this tutorial as a reference.

- You're probably going got need a new `Message` model.
- A `Message` `belongs_to` a `Project`, right?
- Does that then mean that a `Project` `has_many` messages?
- How can we get the current project's `id` into our controller action so that we know which `Project` we're creating a `Message` for?

Don't get too sexy with the returned JavaScript either. Just append a new paragraph to our `#chat-contents` div for the time being.

Good luck!

![Your Turn](/content/images/2015/06/YourTurn-1.png)

------

It makes sense to generate our new `Message` model first, so let's start there. Our messages should have `content` and also a `project_id` field so that we know which project it belongs to.

It's also worth noting that messages will also `belong_to` a User at some point in the future, but as we haven't implemented users yet, we'll leave that for a future article.

Let's generate our `Message` model in our terminal with a Rails generator:

```
bin/rails generate model Message content:text project:belongs_to
```

This will create a content column with a string type and a `project_id` column that will reference our project.

Migrate the generated migration with `bin/rails db:migrate`.

Last, but not least, add a line of code to your `app/models/project.rb` model that will let Rails know that a `Project` `has_many` messages:

```ruby
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  has_many :messages
end
```

You now have a working `Message` model you can play with!

### Saving messages

Let's create the functionality where we can save messages from our chat form and display the result in a very, *very* basic way.

To do that, we're going to need a `message_controller` that will handle the creation of our messages along with the data we'll receive on a successful or failed message creation.

Let's lean on the Rails generators again to do so. In your terminal type and run:

```
bin/rails generate controller Message create
```

Which will create a `message_controller` with a single, empty `create` action.

Let's have that `create` action save a message with a little touch of naive code:

```ruby
def create
  @message = Message.new(message_params)
  
  if @message.save
    format.js
  end
end


private

  def message_params
    params.require(:message).permit(:content, :project_id)
  end
```

It's worth noting here that our create action isn't very secure or robust. We're letting any user create any message for any project (the user could potentially submit any `project_id` that they want from the html form and we're not handling errors at all, but it will do for the moment!

Now that we can create a new message, we'll want to return a very simple snippet of JavaScript that will append our message to the message container in the chat view.

First, create the JavaScript file that will be returned in `app/views/message/create.js.erb`:

```javascript
var chatContainer = document.getElementById('chat-contents')
var chatInput = document.getElementById('message-input')
var paragraph = document.createElement('p')

paragraph.innerHTML = "<%= @message.content %>"

chatContainer.appendChild(paragraph)
chatInput.value = ''
```

And give your new form a trial run!

![Naive Chat Function](/assets/img/posts/basecamp-4/basic-project-chat.gif)

It's important to remember what's happening here is not really what we want.

- Our form is working (yay) and our messages *are* being saved in the database.
- Upon successfully save of a message we're *only rendering the new message on our screen*.
- If you were to refresh your page, you'll lose all of your saved messages.

Let's fix that last issue first and create some nicer looking messages at the same time!

How about you give it a go first?

- Make sure that a bundle of `@messages` are rendered when a user loads the page.
- Try styling each individual message so that it looks nice! Use a partial view for each message and pass that view the content and `created_at` time.

Do your best!

![Your Turn](/content/images/2015/06/YourTurn-1.png)

------

Let's get those messages rendering first.

In your `projects_controller`'s `chat` action you'll have to find your project's messages and assign them to a `@messages` variable:

```ruby
def chat
  @message = Message.new
  @messages = Message.where project_id: params[:id] # Let's find the messages for this project!
  @project = Project.find(params[:id])
end
```

Now if you were to iterate over the `@messages` in your `chat.html.erb` view, you'll see all of your saved messages.

Before we do that though, let's create a partial view for each individual message so that we can add some styling and not repeat ourselves.

Create a new partial view called `message` at `app/views/message/_message.html.erb` and add the following:

```erb
<div class="message-wrap is-owned">
  <div class="message-main-content">
    <div class="message-date">
      <%= time_ago_in_words message.created_at %>
    </div>
    <div class="message-content">
      <p><%= message.content %></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="message-user">
    <p>B</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

You'll notice `time_ago_in_words` which is a handy Rails helper method we'll be using to format our message's `created_at` dates.

We're also hard-coding the user's intials at this point in time, which is fine! We'll fix that up later!

One last thing to note about the above html is the extra class we have alongside `message_wrap` which is `is_owned`. Because we don't have users implemented at the moment, we're assuming that every single message is owned by us as we have no way of identifying if that is true or not for the time being. This is another thing we'll adjust in the future!

Now that we have the html markup for our messages, let's add some CSS to make it look nice!

Add the following to `app/assets/img/stylesheets/message.scss`:

```scss
.message-wrap {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  max-width: 300px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  
  .message-main-content {
    border-radius: 6px;
    padding: 8px;
  }

  .message-content {
    p {
      margin-bottom: 0;
      text-align: right;
    }
  }

  .message-user {
    height: 25px;
    width: 25px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-color: #8067c3;
    align-self: center;
    display: flex;
    align-content: center;
    justify-content: center;

    p {
      text-align: center;
      align-self: center;
      color: #fff;
      margin-bottom: 0;
    }
  }

  .message-date {
    font-size: 0.8rem;
    text-align: right;
  }
}

.message-wrap.is-owned {
  margin-left: auto;
  justify-content: flex-end;

  .message-main-content {
    background-color: #eef9fc;
  }

  .message-user {
    margin-left: 8px;
  }
}
```

Even though we're using the `is-owned` class for every message for the time being, we've broken it out into its own section to make our lives easier in the future.

Last but not least, you'll need to let Rails know to render your messages using your new `_message.html.erb` partial view.



Refresh your chat page and look at your new styling!

![Styled messages!](/assets/img/posts/basecamp-4/styled-messages.png)

Beautiful!

Prepare to be disappointed if you add a new message though, as we haven't leveraged our new `_message.html` view yet!

![Oh no!](/assets/img/posts/basecamp-4/styled-messages-new-message.png)

Let's fix that up now.

Open up the JavaScript file that we're returning from our `message_controller`'s `create` action at `app/views/message/create.js.erb` and get it to utilise our lovely new message partial:

```javascript
var chatContainer = document.getElementById('chat-contents')
var chatInput = document.getElementById('message-input')
var message = "<%= escape_javascript(render "message.html", message: @message) %>"
var div = document.createElement('div')

div.innerHTML = message

chatContainer.appendChild(div.firstChild)
chatInput.value = ''
```

If the above code seems similar, it's because it's pretty close to what we used when rendering our newly created projects earlier in this tutorial!

Test out your new messages and give yourself a massive high five. Make sure no-one is looking first because it'll look really strange.

### Migrating to Action Cable

You're successfully creating new messages for a project, but our users will have to frantically refresh their browser page to have a chat-like experience. This probably isn't a great user experience, so let's make things real time by leveraging Action Cable.

The first thing we should do when setting up Action Cable functionality is to enable authorisation and make sure the current user should have access to the connection at all. We haven't set up users or authorisation for our little app yet, so we'll skip past this for the moment (this is important in real life though!).

What we'll do first instead is create a new channel for our chat feature, which is the Action Cable equivalent of our controller.

We'll call our channel ProjectChat and can use a Rails generator to set it up in our project. First, make sure you're at the root of your project in your terminal of choice and then tap away on your keyboard until you have the following:

```
bin/rails generate channel ProjectChat
```

This generates a new `project_chat_channel.rb` file for us along with some client-side JavaScript that we'll have to use to ensure that the client and server are connected properly via Websockets.

Check out the JavaScript that the rails generator created for us at `app/assets/img/javascripts/channels/project_chat.js`:

```javascript
App.project_chat = App.cable.subscriptions.create('ProjectChatChannel', {
  connected: function () {
    // Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
  },

  disconnected: function () {
    // Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server
  },

  received: function (data) {
    // Called when there's incoming data on the websocket for this channel
  }
})
```

To see if you're getting a connection, you can add a `console.log("We're connected!")` line to the connected function above. Refresh your page and open your browser console and you should see your little message!

Now it's great that we're connected, but there are a few problems with our current implementation; People will connect to our ProjectChat channel even if they're not in a project!

We can fix that by checking for the presence of a `@project.id` instance variable value in our `application.html` layout view and then assign that id to the browser window so that we can reference it later!  It's not as complex as it sounds.

In your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` file add the below just above your `</body>` html tag  and under the `<%= yield %>` call:

```erb
<script>
  <% if @project.id %>
    window.projectId = "<%= @project.id %>";
  <% else %>
    window.projectId = null
  <% end %>
</script>
```

Now we can reference `window.projectId` in our `project_chat.js` file!

Jump back into `app/assets/img/javascripts/channels/project_chat.js` and update the file like so:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', function () {
  if (window.projectId) {
    App.project_chat = App.cable.subscriptions.create(
      {
        channel: 'ProjectChatChannel',
        room: window.projectId
      },
      {
        connected: function () {
          console.log("Hello Channel!")
          // Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
        },

        disconnected: function () {
          // Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server
        },

        received: function (data) {
          // Called when there's incoming data on the websocket for this channel
        }
      }
    )
  }
})
```

You'll notice that we're checking for the `window.projectId` value and if it exists, we'll create a subscription to the correct channel and room. The room we're joining simply uses the project id for the project.

At this point we have a valid connection over web sockets and if you refresh your chat page, you should see a "Hello Channel!" message in your browser console. Now that we're connected, we can implement our chat functionality.

The first thing we need to do is create the client-side functionality that will let us send a message to our channel on the server-side.

In the same `project_chat.js` file, we'll add a few things:

- We'll identify the message form, message input and the message container (where the messages will be rendered) and assign them to variables.
- We'll make sure that we also have our `messageForm` present before we connect to our channel.
- We'll add an event listener for our form that will trigger the sending of our new message, the clearing of our form input and also preventing the standard form submit action (which would refresh your page!).

Here's what that looks like:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', function () {
  const messageForm = document.getElementById("new-message-form")
  const messageInput = document.getElementById("message-input")
  const messageContainer = document.getElementById("chat-contents")
  
  if (window.projectId && messageForm) {
    App.project_chat = App.cable.subscriptions.create(
      {
        channel: 'ProjectChatChannel',
        room: window.projectId
      },
      {
        connected: function () {
          // Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
        },

        disconnected: function () {
          // Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server
        },

        received: function (data) {
          // Called when there's incoming data on the websocket for this channel
        },

        sendMessage: function (content) {
          this.perform('send_message', { content: content, project_id: window.projectId })
        }
      }
    )

    messageForm.addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
      e.preventDefault()
      App.project_chat.sendMessage(messageInput.value)
      messageInput.value = ''
    })
  }
})
```

Something else that you'll notice is that we've created a new `sendMessage` function that will allow us to send our message via web sockets. The function accepts only one argument (content) and we send it along with the project_id of the current project to the server side.

Before we move on, we'll remove the `remote: true` and `url` option from our message form in `app/views/project/chat.html.erb`. This will leave us with a form that just looks like this:

```erb
<%= form_for @message, html: {id: "new-message-form", class: "chat-form"} do |f| %>
  <%= f.hidden_field :project_id, value: @project.id %>
  <div class="form-group">
    <%= f.text_field :content, class: "form-control", id: "message-input", placeholder: "Say something riveting!", autoFocus: true %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

We can remove those fields as we're handling the form's functionality from our `project_chat.js` file.

The first part of our Action Cable functionality is complete! We're collecting the data we need from the browser and sending it to the server via websockets. Now it's time to work our magic from the server-side!

In the above code snippet, take note of the first argument we're passing to `this.perform()`. The `send_message` string will tell Rails what to call from the server side and this is where we'll perform our message saving and the logic to 'broadcast' our new message to all of the other subscribers of our channel (those who are also on the project's chat page).

Open up the channel file at `app/channels/project_chat_channel.rb` and you should see the below:

```ruby
class ProjectChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    # stream_from "some_channel"
  end

  def unsubscribed
    # Any cleanup needed when channel is unsubscribed
  end
end
```

First things first, we have to add some code to our `subscribed` method so that our users will start streaming data that is broadcast (we'll do this in a bit) on this channel.  We'll lean on our project id when updating our `subscribed` method:

```ruby
def subscribed
  project = Project.find(params[:room])
  stream_from "project_channel_#{project.id}"
end
```

So if a user is subscribed to the Project Chat Channel, and we broadcast something to the `project_channel_#{project.id}`, they'll receive that data in their browser!

Now remember, how we used `send_message` as a string identifier for our message? Let's create that method in our `ProjectChatChannel` file now.

```ruby
class ProjectChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    project = Project.find(params[:room])
    stream_from "project_channel_#{project.id}"
  end

  def unsubscribed
    # Any cleanup needed when channel is unsubscribed
  end

  def send_message(data)
    project_id = data["project_id"]
    content = data["content"]

    message = Message.create!(content: content, project_id: project_id)
    ActionCable.server.broadcast("project_channel_#{project_id}", message: render_message(message))
  end

  private

    def render_message(message)
      MessageController.render partial: 'message/message', locals: {message: message}
    end
end
```

Let's step through this step by step.

- Our `send_message` method receives one argument, our data. This is the data we passed to it from our JavaScript we wrote above (the content and the project_id). You can always inspect the data using `puts data` within the `send_message` method if you want to check it out.
- We assign our `project_id` and `content` data to variables from the `data` hash that we've received.
- We create a new message using our content and project id.
- Once created, we broadcast a rendered message back do the subscribers of our channel.
- The rendered message is created in our private `render_message` method. This lets us use our `_message.html.erb` partial to return to the client.

And that's it!

OK, so we've got the client sending data to the server and we have the server saving that data as a new message and then broadcasting that message to the channel's subscribers.

Now it's time to handle the broadcast message back on the client-side!

Think of this communication as a loop:

- Client performs an action which is handled with JavaScript.
- Server side does something and broadcasts a response to all subscribers.
- Client receives the response and we use JavaScript to determine what happens to this response.

So let's go back to the client side and re-open our `app/assets/img/javascripts/channels/project_chat.js` file. Within this file, it's the `received()` function that is called when the client-side receives data.

Remember, you can just pop a `console.log(data)` in your function to inspect what's being returned if you get lost!

Now, in our `received` function, we'll:

- Transform our returned message into something we can render on the browser.
- Append our new message to our message container!

Here's the whole `project_chat.js` file with the updated `received` function:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('turbolinks:load', function () {
  const messageForm = document.getElementById("new-message-form")
  const messageInput = document.getElementById("message-input")
  const messageContainer = document.getElementById("chat-contents")


  if (window.projectId && messageForm) {
    App.project_chat = App.cable.subscriptions.create(
      {
        channel: 'ProjectChatChannel',
        room: window.projectId
      },
      {
        connected: function () {
          // Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
        },

        disconnected: function () {
          // Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server
        },

        received: function (data) {
          var messageNode = document.createElement('div')
          messageNode.innerHTML = data.message
          messageContainer.appendChild(messageNode)
        },

        sendMessage: function (content) {
          this.perform('send_message', { content, project_id: window.projectId })
        }
      }
    )

    messageForm.addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
      e.preventDefault()
      App.project_chat.sendMessage(messageInput.value)
      messageInput.value = ''
    })
  }
})
```

Your chat functionality should be working like a dream at this point. Open the chat page in two browser windows and be amazed at what you've created.

### Wrapping Up

Now that the `send_message` method is handling the saving of your new messages, you can actually delete the contents of your `app/controllers/message_controller.rb`, leaving you with:

```ruby
class MessageController < ApplicationController
end
```

This controller is no longer the recipient of any requests!

The `app/views/message/create.js.erb` file is no also redundant, so feel free to delete that as well.

Another thing worth tidying up from the last article is the way we handled our `turbolinks:load` event in our `app/assets/img/javascripts/project.js` file.  Let's move that listener *out* so that it fires before we check for the `new-project-form`.

I was getting errors when trying to create new projects without doing the above!

Now, there are a few issues with what we've created for our live chat, which are worthwhile **not doing** on a real app.

- No authentication! This means that all messages are anonymous and appear on the right side of the screen.
- We should use Rails jobs to handle the queuing of messages to be sent back to our users. When DHH created a Action Cable video tutorial upon the release of Action Cable, he does exactly this.
- There's no error handling in our `send_message` method when we create our message. This is bad practice!

But hey, we got our chat room working and that's good enough for the moment!

Until next time,
